# IoT-devices-spam-detection
A machine learning model that identifies spam/anomalous data received by IoT devices. The data set used
for this model consists of 32 features and around 5000 rows of data. Instead of using terminal/CLI , we
developed a user friendly website where user can upload training data, tain/test it and can see the
prediction.The website also consists a performance page that depicts correlation analysis and confusion matrix
